            <h3>Cherry sideloading</h3>
            <p>This was inspired by Sam of samhub, when he quit eonhub he made a server and i did not. Cherry sideloading contains a library of ipas and much more, check it out at <a><href>https://download.aurorasigner.xyz</href></a></p>

            <h3>Aurora Signer</h3>
            <p>When we were hardstuck at 1k members in CSL, i thought to myself: "what do those random ass kids server not have" and my brain shouted 'a signer' into my head </p>

            <h3>Music theory/production</h3>
            <p>i do like to mess around in music software, overall i enjoy listening to music bc it gives you a sense of weightlessness and you feel like everything else is unimportant. Not only that it helps me focus a little more when making sites such as this one.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>PC building</h3>
            <p>Honestly if i had the money to id buy pcs just to tear them apart and see whats inside, thats no the only aspect i enjoy about it though, i admire the construction of them and enjoy building PCS generally. Sure its stressful, But isnt that the point?</p>
